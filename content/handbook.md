## Theory of Change

Nashville renters have little-to-no legal protection from eviction, unjustified rent raises, and poor living conditions. Housing should be a human right, and not an investment opportunity for the wealthy. Everyone deserves safe, dignified and guaranteed housing. We are human beings and not just a way to make a profit. We want tenant protection under the law, ability to hold landlords accountable, and decision-making power within our own city.
 
You and I can achieve these goals by uniting through shared struggles as the Renters’ Union of Nashville. Led by renters, this union provides a structure to fight for improvements of our living conditions. Organized renters rising together is how we build a better world.

## Core Values Statement

### Respectful and direct communication

1. In order to build collective tenant-driven power, we need respectful and direct communication. Respectful communication helps us recognize the inherent humanity in us all, as well as our unique and valuable differences. Direct communication allows us to not be tripped up by unnecessary conflict and creates an inclusive environment. Do not use personal put-downs or derogatory language. Avoid idioms and euphemisms. Refer to people as they refer to themselves (i.e. pronouns, identities). Do your best to be clear/straightforward/exact about your needs, frustrations, and joys. 

### Our movement is built by, for, and with renters of all backgrounds
1. Full and active participation of all tenants–of all races, ethnicities, classes, genders, religions, ability statuses, citizenship statuses, sexual orientations–is what makes us strong.
1. Only tenants have the power to improve our conditions, and we unite and work collectively to achieve equitable housing for all. Nashville renters are vital members of the community and economy, and we demand that we are treated as such.
1. Within our movement, we strive to provide access for tenants of all walks of life. We believe that this is achieved through leadership by and contributions from a diverse group of tenants.

### Our movement will continue to recognize and combat discrimination in all forms.

1. To be a member of this union, one must recognize and outcast their own actions that support racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism… any treatment of fellow human beings that dehumanizes them and diminishes their struggle.
1. We can NOT address class discrimination without addressing the intersections of oppression that exist among social categories- races, genders, sexual orientations, ethnicities, and abilities. Liberation from oppressive systems is for all people. We will not allow groups of folks or individuals to fall through the cracks. Conflict when organizing is natural, but conflict rooted in bigotry and fear will not be tolerated. 
1. Any hatred shown to another organizer will be addressed swiftly, those expressing this hatred will only be welcomed back into the group after going through our conflict-resolution process. Keep in mind the racist, sexist, homophobic structures that exist within this society. While our work is to dismantle those structures, none of us are immune to its effects. It will require a near daily rejection of many harmful and hurtful practices that we have been taught. We must all reject discrimination together to create a better world.

## Getting to Know Your Neighbors

“Strangers are just friends we haven’t met”

Community starts at home with the people around you! It is important to get to know your neighbors in your apartment complex or block! Let’s take a page out Mr. Roger’s Book and be a good neighbor!

### Why is getting to know your neighbors important?

* When you run out of sugar
* When you need help with yard work
* If you made too many biscuits
* If you want to make united changes to your street or apartment floor
* To build relationships with the people around us
* To support you when you may need
* For neighborhood safety, you’ll be less likely to call the cops

### How to get to know your neighbors?

* Share those extra biscuits
* Offer to help out with yard work!
* Offer support (or sugar) when in your capacity
* Block parties!
* Tea time

## Renters' Rights

### Chapter 1

1. What to do when you find problems before you move in.
When you are doing your walk-through make sure to make a list and to take photos of every small thing you think is an issue or could be an issue further down the line. 

    1. Ask the landlord to fix the problems before you move in. More than likely they will say no and move on to the next person waiting in line. If they do say no make sure they sign something that says they agree what needs to be fixed will be fixed within your lease agreement.  
    1. Regardless of what happens, make sure that your new landlord signs and dates the list. This list may not come up again until you move out to get your security deposit back. So make sure that you keep this in a safe place.
    1. Are you concerned that large repairs are needed? Typically if you think they are big your landlord knows about them and they are big. The only way to know for sure is to have someone inspect the home. 
1. Your landlord cannot change the terms of your lease after you have signed it while you are renting in the middle of the dates listed on the lease. However, changes can be made to word smith the document. But it cannot alter what the initial document says unless you also agree to those new terms. When you are negotiating please never do it alone, have a friend, family, or union member with you. Your landlord can’t make other changes to the rules. Don’t like the rules? Then don’t sign the lease. 
1. Always take pictures of the home before you move in, any damage/repairs your landlord would be responsible for, and keep any important communications written down, copies of emails are critical. In the event you need to file a violation, you will need evidence to back up your claims. 
1. The rights of those who are legally disabled 
    1. This includes: 
        1. People who do not see or hear well 
        1. People using wheelchairs/ walking assistance  
        1. People who have intellectual disabilities
        1. People with AIDS or HIV virus 
        1. People with mental or physical disabilities 
        1. People whose doctor or therapist prescribed a service or emotional support pet. 
    1. If you have a disability, the landlord must bend their rules if they are preventing you from living there. This only applies if being without that assistance would prevent someone from living peacefully in their home. The landlord can refuse to do it if they can prove it would be a hardship to accommodate a disability. A hardship is determined by something that would take too much time or money to complete. 
        1. Example: A “no-pets” apartment must let a blind person keep a seeing-eye dog. This action cost no time or money to change. On the other end. 
        1. Example: a two story apartment only has second story availability with no ramp or elevator. Someone who uses a walker cannot request an elevator be installed because the money and time it would take to install would be considered too much for the landlord. 
    1. Reasonable accommodations can also apply to when you are required to pay rent. Go to the when you can't pay rent section to learn more.

## Glossary

A glossary of organizing terms - in the context of Renters Union Nashville (RUN):

Agitation: This is not pestering, annoying or bothering someone with “bad faith” attacks. Agitation is asking open-ended questions to identify each person’s self-interest. It is reminding the person who they wish to be and encouraging them to take the necessary steps to do so. It is holding a conversation with the specific goals of activating their imagination and guiding them to action.

Committee: A democratic group of people dedicated to the interests of renters. In an individual complex, these committees should amplify the voices of those who live in their immediate surroundings. There may be individual apartment complex committees and there may be committees united under a specific property owner. Any group of people elected to represent and amplify the needs of the renters they represent should also have accountability to those renters.

Default of Defendant: Legalese (lawyer speak) which states that the  defendant (renter) or their lawyer were not present for their court date and a letter for extension was not filed. This typically results in a judgment awarded to the plaintiff (landlord) and means that a writ of restitution (the violent removal of a renter from their housing) is likely to be filed with the sheriff’s office to complete the eviction process.

Detainer Warrant: In the eviction process, after a 14-day notice to evict (which they can ignore, if written into the lease), the landlord or property manager files a detainer warrant through the County Circuit Court Clerk. In Davidson county, this is Joseph P. Day (2023). Once the detainer is filed, a process server delivers the warrant to the defendant’s address. While it is suggested they hand the warrant to the defendant, it is not required. Warrants can be posted on doors and may be served within one week of the defendant’s court date.

Facilitator: Meetings can sometimes be a circus. Especially when there are many people in a room trying to share their knowledge. A facilitator holds our time as valuable and works to recognize those in the room who haven’t shared. They also recognize when we should move to the next topic. The “ring-leader” for a set amount of time. It is also important that facilitators be open to feedback on their facilitation after meetings are over.

General Meetings: These are our monthly, city-wide meetings offered in-person or through video conferencing. Here is the opportunity to come together, learn from our experiences (expertise) and gain momentum to keep moving the union forward. Stories should be shared within the context of our shared struggle.

Hotline: This is our Google Voice number. When renters call the hotline, they are directed to a voicemail. They can also send texts to this number. Should be considered a tool to connect with renters. Responses to hotline calls and texts should be done by volunteers in the union.

### Housing as a Human Right 

#### Led by Renters

Mass e-mails: This is an email blast sent to multiple parties. Usually used to make regular announcements or invite people to an event.

One-on-one: An important tool in building the Union. This is a personal, individual conversation for a purpose. The reasoning for such a conversation can be vast but there are often two plans: to grow a relationship and to agitate towards action. We must constantly be talking to each other, developing trust in one another and engaging our neighbors in the work of strengthening your union.

Very aspirational. 
Maybe add some language that is more direct. Ie. a less formal, more intimate interaction between two people outside of general or cadre meetings,  intended to build relationships or plan. 

#### Organized Renters 

Phone-banking: This is simply a group of union members coming together to call anyone that has expressed interest or attended a meeting. It’s encouraged to have a goal in these conversations, but this is a good way to follow up with people we have met through door-knocking or in another social event.

Renters Union: A collection of renters (tenants) that are working together to develop plans and take action (!) to make REAL change, together. Individually we are unable to build the power to force change and a union is the best way to collectively move to make demands (and take the power).

#### Shared Struggles 

Stack: This is how we hold organized discussions. Formed from discussions online during a pandemic, it’s a way to order who speaks next. We may choose a “totem” or object to pass around, but the point is always the same. Your expertise and input is important. We don’t want others talking over you while you share the important information you have.

Tenant Protection: 
Text-banking: Similar to phone-banking. You are following a previous conversation with a detailed reminder of a meeting, party or other social event. Short messages that jog your memory.

### Resources, Housing Orgs and more

Section 8 Housing: The Housing Choice Vouchers Program (often referred to as “Section 8”) is the federal government's (HUD) primary program to provide housing for very low-income families, as well as the elderly and disabled. It provides qualifying families with assistance in paying their monthly rent. This process is enacted in Nashville through MDHA.

HRDC - Housing Resource Diversionary Court: This is the L.E.G.A.C.Y Court that Judge Bell created (Let Every Goal Achieve Continuous Yields) in Nashville in order to help residents facing eviction. From the website: “Provides tools to support and foster mutual trust between landlords and tenants while seeking CARES Grant relief money” (Honestly, follow the link and contact them because the money changes hands too often for us to direct you to who has it) https://gscourt.nashville.gov/about-us/judges/division-viii-judge-rachel-l-bell/l-e-g-a-c-y-housing-resource-diversionary-court-and-program/
